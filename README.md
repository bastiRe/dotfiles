# Dotfiles

My dotfiles, thrown together over the years. I'm using iTerm2, ZSH with oh-my-zsh, TMUX and Neovim.

## External dependencies

- [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh): `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
- [zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions): `brew install zsh-completions`
- [reattach-to-user-namespace](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-copy-and-paste-with-tmux-on-mac-os-x): `brew install reattach-to-user-namespace` (Copy paste with tmux)
- [Python support for Neovim](https://github.com/zchee/deoplete-jedi/wiki/Setting-up-Python-for-Neovim) (needed for deoplete plugin)

## TODO
